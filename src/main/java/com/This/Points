This keyword
============
This used to tell the compile to use the object variable. If not specified , compiler will infer it by looking at the object creation
Please note that the infer will only happen if the variable names are different
modify(String color, String type) {
		this();  //This calls the Car() constructor and executes the car count 
		color = color;
		type = type;
	}

color and color points to the same variable, 
When ever a method is called , the method gets a frame in stack which holds all the variables. In this case when modify is called ,
It gets a frame in stack that holds color and type .
When the statement color = color is executed, the system treats it as local variable in frame.To avoid this and tell the 
compiler to use object variable use this keyword.


Chaining of constructors
========================
this(); can be used to call the other constructor with in the class, please note that this() has to be this first statement in the constructor ,
chaining needs to be performed. 

	Car(String color, String type) {
		this();  //This calls the Car() constructor and executes the car count 
		this.color = color;
		this.type = type;
	}
