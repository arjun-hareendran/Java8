Static variable
===============

THe static variable are created when class is loaded .
	Example: Car mycar ; 
		With this code the static variable will loaded.
		
The variable is reference with class name and not object name
	Example: Car.carcount
	
You also can use object to reference, will throw a warning.

Please note that the carcount variable is associated with the class and not the instance. There is special place in Heap for classes and
static variable reside along with class. 	


Stack is used for reference objects.
	Car mycar = new Car(); 
	mycar lives in Stack and in heap you will have all the methods and variable associated with car.
	


Static Method
=============

Use static keyword. Same rules applies as static variables.
Cannot use non-static variables in static methods. Object variables cannot be used.

Null pointer exception is thrown for static classes.
	
	Math m = null;
    double result = m.floor(28.15); // Confusing code, but it works.
    

Static initialization Block
========================

It will only exuecute once and not for all the object creation
You can have multiple blocks in the same code.
